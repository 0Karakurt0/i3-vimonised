# Configuration for i3 with vim philosophy
To install just run ./install script and specify installation directory.
## How it works
Same as in VI, there are Verbs and Nouns. To preform an action you just combine two of them and an argument.
##### Verbs:
 - Toggle
 - Change
 - Move
 - Remove
 - Focus
 - Start
##### Nouns:
 - Window
 - System
 - Manager
 - workspAce
 - Player

 Full list of words and arguments you can see in Keys.txt

 If you have a WM+DE action that cannot be described by these words, please write an issue.

## Problems
 - Not all words are implemented (transitioning to V2)
 - BUG with i3-repeater - d3w closes only 3 windows
 - BUG - resizing actions are ignored
 - ISSUE - r10h is't comfortable even after implementing procentage input
 - ISSUE - freezing windows breaks functionality of some multi-window programms)

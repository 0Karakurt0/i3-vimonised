Configuration for i3 with vim philosophy
 What is working
  Delete
  dw(window), dd (parent), da(all), dn(notification), dN(all notifications)
  Move:
  mh, mj, mk, ml, mf(to floating)
  Go:
  gh, gj, gk, gl, gp(previous), gn(next), gf(to floating)
  lt(launch terminal)
  Resize:
  rNh, rNj, rNk, rNl where N in a number up to 2000
 
i, s, q, Return

Plans:
 - add mt, ms, gs, gw (moving between workspaces and windows)
 - maybe get rid of madness (resize modes) through i3-input (how???)
 - add more commands (which?)
